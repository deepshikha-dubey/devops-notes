101 — Create Your First Git Repository

Step 1 Create a workspace directory
Start by creating a clean directory for this lesson. This keeps your practice organized and separate from other projects.

Commands to Run
mkdir -p ~/git-practice/lesson-101
cd ~/git-practice/lesson-101

What This Does
The `mkdir -p` command creates a directory and any necessary parent directories. The `cd` command changes your current directory to the newly created folder.

Expected Outcome
You should now be in the `git-practice/lesson-101` directory. You can verify this by running `pwd` (print working directory).

Pro Tips
1 Use `pwd` to confirm you're in the right directory
2 The `-p` flag prevents errors if the parent directory already exists

Step 2 Verify Git installation
Before we start, let's make sure Git is properly installed and configured on your system.

Commands to Run
git --version
git config --global user.name
git config --global user.email

What This Does
The first command checks your Git version. The next two commands display your Git identity, which will be attached to all your commits.

Expected Outcome
You should see:
- A version number (e.g., git version 2.x.x)
- Your name
- Your email address

Pro Tips
1 If your name or email is not set, configure them with:
2 git config --global user.name "Your Name"
3 git config --global user.email "you@example.com"

Step 3 Initialize a Git repository
Transform your regular directory into a Git repository. This creates a hidden `.git` folder that tracks all changes.

Commands to Run
git init

What This Does
The `git init` command initializes a new Git repository in the current directory. It creates a `.git` subdirectory containing all necessary Git metadata and object database.

Expected Outcome
You should see: "Initialized empty Git repository in /path/to/git-practice/lesson-101/.git/"

Pro Tips
1 You can view the .git directory with `ls -la`
2 Never manually edit files inside .git - use Git commands instead

Step 4 Check repository status
Learn to check the current state of your repository. This is one of the most frequently used Git commands.

Commands to Run
git status

What This Does
`git status` shows which files are tracked, modified, or ready to be committed. It's your window into what Git sees.

Expected Outcome
You should see "On branch main" (or master) and "No commits yet" with "nothing to commit".

Pro Tips
1 Run `git status` frequently - it's safe and informative
2 This command never changes anything, just reports

Step 5 Create and stage your first file
Create a README file and prepare it for your first commit by adding it to the staging area.

Commands to Run
echo "# My First Git Repository" > README.md
git status
git add README.md
git status

What This Does
The staging area (or index) is like a preparation area for commits. `git add` moves changes from your working directory to the staging area. Notice how `git status` output changes after adding the file.

Expected Outcome
After `git add`, you should see "Changes to be committed:" with "new file: README.md" listed in green.

Pro Tips
1 You can add multiple files at once with `git add file1 file2`
2 Use `git add .` to add all changes in the current directory (use carefully!)

Step 6 Make your first commit
Create a permanent snapshot of your staged changes. This is the heart of version control.

Commands to Run
git commit -m "Initial commit: Add README"

What This Does
A commit is a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time. The `-m` flag lets you add a commit message inline. Good commit messages describe *why* you made the change, not just *what* changed.

Expected Outcome
You should see output like "[main (root-commit) abc1234] Initial commit: Add README" followed by file statistics.

Pro Tips
1 Write clear, concise commit messages
2 Use present tense: "Add feature" not "Added feature"
3 If you need multiple lines, omit -m and Git will open your default editor

Step 7 View your commit history
Learn to view the history of commits in your repository.

Commands to Run
git log
git log --oneline

What This Does
`git log` shows the commit history. The `--oneline` flag provides a compact view with just the commit hash and message. Each commit has a unique SHA-1 hash identifier.

Expected Outcome
You should see your commit with its hash, author info, date, and message. The `--oneline` version shows a shortened hash and message.

Pro Tips
1 Press 'q' to exit the log view if it opens in a pager
2 Try `git log --graph --all` for a visual representation of branches (useful later)
3 Use `git show` to see details of the most recent commit

Step 8 Practice: Make more commits
Reinforce what you've learned by making additional commits on your own.

Commands to Run
echo "## About This Project" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Add project description section"
echo "Git is awesome!" > notes.txt
git add notes.txt
git commit -m "Add learning notes"

What This Does
Practice makes perfect! Notice the workflow: modify → add → commit. This cycle is fundamental to Git. The `>>` operator appends to a file instead of overwriting it.

Expected Outcome
Running `git log --oneline` should now show three commits.

Pro Tips
1 Commit early, commit often - small commits are easier to understand
2 Each commit should represent one logical change
3 Use `git diff` before `git add` to review what changed

✓ Initialize a Git repository
✓ Stage changes with `git add`
✓ Create commits with meaningful messages
✓ View your project history with `git log`
