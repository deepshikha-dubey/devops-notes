203 — Docker Networking Fundamentals

Step 1 Understanding Docker network drivers
Learn about the different network types Docker provides.

Commands to Run
docker network ls
docker network inspect bridge

What This Does
Docker creates three networks by default: bridge (default for containers), host (shares host network), and none (no networking). Each serves different use cases.

Expected Outcome
You'll see the default networks. Inspect shows bridge network details including subnet, gateway, and connected containers.

Pro Tips
1 bridge: Default, provides isolation and internal network
2 host: Container uses host's network directly (no isolation)
3 none: No networking, complete isolation
4 Custom networks provide better DNS and isolation than default bridge
