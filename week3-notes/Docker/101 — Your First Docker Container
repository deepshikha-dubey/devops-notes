101 — Your First Docker Container

Step 1 Verify Docker installation
Before we start, let's make sure Docker is properly installed and running on your system.

Commands to Run
docker --version
docker info

What This Does
The first command checks your Docker version. The `docker info` command displays system-wide information including the number of containers and images.

Expected Outcome
You should see:
- Docker version (e.g., Docker version 24.x.x)
- System information showing Docker is running

Pro Tips
1 If Docker isn't running, start Docker Desktop (Mac/Windows) or the Docker daemon (Linux)
2 On Linux, you might need to use `sudo` before docker commands

Step 2 Run your first container
Let's run the classic "Hello World" container to verify everything works.

Commands to Run
docker run hello-world

What This Does
This command does several things: it checks if the `hello-world` image exists locally, downloads it if not (from Docker Hub), creates a container from that image, runs it, and displays output.

Expected Outcome
You should see a message starting with "Hello from Docker!" explaining what just happened. The container runs, prints the message, and exits.

Pro Tips
1 This is a one-time container - it runs and stops automatically
2 The image is now cached locally for future use

Step 3 Understanding what just happened
Let's see the containers and images on your system.

Commands to Run
docker images
docker ps -a

What This Does
`docker images` lists all images (templates) on your machine. `docker ps -a` shows all containers (instances), including stopped ones. Without `-a`, it only shows running containers.

Expected Outcome
You should see:
- The `hello-world` image listed
- One exited container created from that image

Pro Tips
1 Images are like classes, containers are like instances
2 Think of images as the recipe, containers as the meal
3 Use `docker ps` (without -a) to see only running containers

Step 4 Run an interactive container
Let's run a container that stays alive and lets you interact with it.

Commands to Run
docker run -it ubuntu bash

What This Does
The `-i` flag keeps the container's input stream open (interactive). The `-t` flag allocates a pseudo-terminal. `ubuntu` is the image name, and `bash` is the command to run inside the container.

Expected Outcome
Your terminal prompt should change to something like `root@abc123:/#` - you're now inside the Ubuntu container!

Pro Tips
1 You're now inside a minimal Ubuntu Linux environment
2 Try running `ls`, `pwd`, or `cat /etc/os-release` to explore
3 Type `exit` to leave the container and return to your host machine

Step 5 Explore inside the container
While inside the Ubuntu container, let's explore and make some changes.

Commands to Run
cat /etc/os-release
echo "Hello from inside Docker!" > test.txt
cat test.txt
exit

What This Does
These commands run inside the container, not on your host machine. The file you created exists only in this container's filesystem. When you `exit`, you leave the container.

Expected Outcome
You should see Ubuntu version info, create a file, read it, then return to your normal terminal prompt.

Pro Tips
1 Notice how the prompt changes back when you exit
2 The container still exists (stopped state) with your changes
3 We'll see how to restart it in the next step

Step 6 View all containers
Let's see all the containers we've created so far.

Commands to Run
docker ps -a

What This Does
This shows all containers regardless of state. You should see the `hello-world` container (Exited) and the Ubuntu container you just exited.

Expected Outcome
You'll see a table with columns: CONTAINER ID, IMAGE, COMMAND, CREATED, STATUS, NAMES. Both containers should show STATUS as "Exited".

Pro Tips
1 Each container gets a unique ID and a random name
2 The NAMES column shows randomly generated names like "friendly_einstein"
3 You can reference containers by ID or name in other commands

Step 7 Run a web server container
Let's run something more practical - a simple web server that stays running.

Commands to Run
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name my-nginx nginx

What This Does
The `-d` flag runs in detached mode (background). `-p 8080:80` maps port 8080 on your host to port 80 in the container. `--name` gives it a friendly name instead of a random one.

Expected Outcome
You should see a long container ID printed, and your terminal prompt returns immediately. The container runs in the background.

Pro Tips
1 Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser to see nginx running!
2 The `-d` flag is crucial for long-running services
3 Port mapping format is always `host:container`

Step 8 View running containers and logs
Let's check our running container and see what it's doing.

Commands to Run
docker ps
docker logs my-nginx

What This Does
`docker ps` (without -a) shows only running containers. `docker logs` displays what the container has output to stdout/stderr.

Expected Outcome
You should see `my-nginx` listed as running (UP status) and nginx access logs when you view the logs.

Pro Tips
1 Refresh http://localhost:8080 in your browser and run `docker logs my-nginx` again to see new log entries
2 Use `docker logs -f my-nginx` to follow logs in real-time (like `tail -f`)
3 Press Ctrl+C to stop following logs

Step 9 Stop and remove containers
Learn to clean up containers when you're done with them.

Commands to Run
docker stop my-nginx
docker ps -a
docker rm my-nginx
docker ps -a

What This Does
`docker stop` gracefully stops a running container. `docker rm` removes a stopped container completely. Notice how the container disappears from the list after removal.

Expected Outcome
After `stop`, the container status changes to "Exited". After `rm`, it's completely gone from `docker ps -a`.

Pro Tips
1 You can combine: `docker rm -f my-nginx` to force-remove a running container
2 Use `docker container prune` to remove all stopped containers at once
3 Removing a container doesn't remove the image - it's still cached

Step 10 Practice: Run and interact with a container
Reinforce what you've learned by running another container on your own.

Commands to Run
docker run -d -p 8081:80 --name my-apache httpd
docker ps
docker logs my-apache
docker stop my-apache
docker rm my-apache

What This Does
This follows the full container lifecycle: run in background, check it's running, view logs, stop it, and clean up. The `httpd` image is Apache web server.

Expected Outcome
You should be able to visit http://localhost:8081 and see Apache's default page. Then successfully stop and remove the container.

Pro Tips
1 Try different port numbers to avoid conflicts
2 Practice naming containers with `--name` for easier management
3 Use `docker images` to see all the images you've downloaded

✓ Run Docker containers from images
✓ Understand the difference between images and containers
✓ Interact with containers using `-it` flags
✓ Run containers in the background with `-d`
✓ Map ports with `-p` to access services
✓ View logs and manage container lifecycle
