1. Search for images on Docker Hub

docker search nginx
docker search --filter stars=1000 nginx

What This Does
The `docker search` command queries Docker Hub for images. The filter option helps you find popular, well-maintained images with many stars.

2. Pull a specific image

docker pull nginx

What This Does
This downloads the nginx image from Docker Hub. Without a tag, it defaults to 'latest'. The image is stored locally and can be used to create containers.

3. Understanding image tags
Pull different versions of the same image using tags.

Commands to Run
docker pull nginx:1.25
docker pull nginx:alpine
docker images nginx

What This Does
Tags specify versions or variants. Format is `image:tag`. Alpine variants are minimal Linux distributions, resulting in smaller images.


4. Inspect image details
View detailed information about an image including layers, environment variables, and metadata.

Commands to Run
docker inspect nginx:latest
docker history nginx:latest

What This Does
`docker inspect` shows JSON metadata including config, layers, and environment. `docker history` displays the build commands that created each layer.

5. List all local images
View all images stored on your machine with size information.

Commands to Run
docker images
docker images --format "table {{.Repository}}\t{{.Tag}}\t{{.Size}}"

What This Does
The first command shows all images. The second formats output to show only repository, tag, and size for clarity.
