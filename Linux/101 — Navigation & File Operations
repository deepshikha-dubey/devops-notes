Step 1 Check your current location
Learn to see where you are in the filesystem using pwd (print working directory).

Commands to Run
pwd

What This Does
pwd shows your current location in the filesystem. When you open a terminal, you typically start in your home directory (/home/username on Linux or /Users/username on macOS).

Expected Outcome
You'll see your current directory path, like /home/yourusername or /Users/yourusername

Pro Tips
1 pwd stands for 'print working directory'
2 Think of it as 'where am I right now?'
3 Use pwd whenever you're unsure of your location
