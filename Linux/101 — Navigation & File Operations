101 — Navigation & File Operations

Step 1 Check your current location
Learn to see where you are in the filesystem using pwd (print working directory).

Commands to Run
pwd

What This Does
pwd shows your current location in the filesystem. When you open a terminal, you typically start in your home directory (/home/username on Linux or /Users/username on macOS).

Expected Outcome
You'll see your current directory path, like /home/yourusername or /Users/yourusername

Pro Tips
1 pwd stands for 'print working directory'
2 Think of it as 'where am I right now?'
3 Use pwd whenever you're unsure of your location

Step 2 List files in your current directory
Use ls to see what files and folders exist in your current location.

Commands to Run
ls
Copy
ls -l
Copy
ls -la
Copy
What This Does
ls lists directory contents. -l shows detailed info (permissions, size, date). -a shows hidden files (those starting with .). -la combines both flags.

Expected Outcome
First command shows visible files/folders. -l shows detailed listing with permissions and sizes. -la includes hidden files like .bashrc and .profile

Pro Tips
1 ls = basic list
2 ls -l = long format (detailed)
3 ls -a = all files (including hidden)
4 ls -lh = human-readable sizes (KB, MB instead of bytes)
5 Hidden files start with a dot (.)

Step 3 Navigate to a different directory

Commands to Run
cd /tmp
pwd
cd ~
pwd
cd -
pwd

What This Does
cd changes your current directory. /tmp is an absolute path. ~ is shorthand for home directory. - returns to previous directory. Always pwd after cd to confirm location.

Pro Tips
1 cd with no arguments goes to home directory
2 cd ~ explicitly goes to home
3 cd - toggles between last two directories (super useful!)
4 cd .. goes up one level to parent directory


Step 5 Create nested directories
Create multiple directory levels at once using mkdir -p.

Commands to Run
mkdir -p projects/web/frontend
ls
ls projects
ls projects/web

What This Does
mkdir -p creates parent directories as needed. Without -p, mkdir fails if parent doesn't exist. This creates projects, then web inside it, then frontend inside web.

Expected Outcome
projects directory created. Inside it: web directory. Inside web: frontend directory. All created with one command.

Pro Tips
1 -p flag means 'create parents as needed'
2 Without -p, you'd need three separate mkdir commands
3 Use -p when creating nested structures
4 -p doesn't error if directory already exists (safe to re-run)

Step 6 Navigate using relative paths
Move around using paths relative to current location.

Commands to Run
pwd
cd projects/web
pwd
cd ..
pwd
cd ../..
pwd

What This Does
Relative paths start from current location. projects/web goes down two levels. .. goes up one level. ../.. goes up two levels. No leading / means relative.

Expected Outcome
Start in devops-practice, move to web, back to projects, back to devops-practice. pwd after each confirms.

Pro Tips
1 . = current directory
2 .. = parent directory
3 ../.. = grandparent (two levels up)
4 ../../other = go up two, then into 'other'
5 Paths without leading / are relative

Step 7 List contents recursively
View entire directory tree at once.

Commands to Run
pwd
ls -R
tree

What This Does
ls -R lists recursively (shows all subdirectories). tree shows a visual tree structure (may need installation). Both reveal the full hierarchy.

Expected Outcome
ls -R shows all nested directories and their contents. tree (if installed) shows beautiful tree diagram.

Pro Tips
1 ls -R shows everything but can be overwhelming
2 tree is not built-in but super useful (install with: brew install tree or apt install tree)
3 Use tree when you want to visualize structure
4 Limit depth with: tree -L 2 (only 2 levels deep)

Step 8 
Remove directories
Clean up directories using rmdir and rm.

Commands to Run
cd ~/devops-practice
rmdir projects/web/frontend
rmdir projects/web
rmdir projects
ls

What This Does
rmdir removes empty directories only. Must delete from deepest level upward. rm -r removes directories and contents (dangerous!). Always use rmdir when possible for safety.

Expected Outcome
Directories removed in order: frontend first, then web, then projects. ls shows they're gone.

Pro Tips
1 rmdir only works on EMPTY directories (safe)
2 rm -r removes directory AND all contents (dangerous, no undo!)
3 rm -rf is extremely dangerous (force removal, no confirmation)
4 Always double-check with pwd before rm -r
5 Practice with test directories before using on real files


step 9  Tab completion saves time
Use Tab key to autocomplete paths and avoid typos.

Commands to Run
cd ~
mkdir -p long-directory-name/with-many-levels/to-practice-tab
cd lon<TAB>
cd wit<TAB>
cd to-<TAB>
pwd

What This Does
Press Tab after typing first few letters. Shell completes the rest. Double-Tab shows all matches if ambiguous. This prevents typos and saves time.

Expected Outcome
Tab autocompletes each directory name. You navigate to full path by typing ~20 characters instead of 60+. Much faster!

Pro Tips
1 Tab is your best friend in the shell
2 Double-Tab shows all possible completions
3 Works for commands, files, directories, and options
4 Prevents typos in long paths
5 If Tab does nothing, no match exists (typo or wrong location)

Step 10 Clean up practice directory
Remove all practice files before finishing.

Commands to Run
cd ~
rm -r devops-practice
ls

What This Does
rm -r removes directory and all contents. Safe here since it's practice files. Always pwd before rm -r to confirm location!

Expected Outcome
devops-practice directory completely removed. ls confirms it's gone.

Pro Tips
1 Always pwd before rm -r (safety check)
2 Add -i flag for confirmation: rm -ri (prompts before each deletion)
3 There is NO undo for rm (files gone forever)
4 Consider using trash/trash-cli instead of rm for safety


 Navigate with pwd, cd, and ls
✓ Create directories with mkdir and mkdir -p
✓ Understand absolute vs relative paths
✓ Use Tab completion for efficiency
✓ Safely remove directories
